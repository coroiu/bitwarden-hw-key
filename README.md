# POC: Bitwarden Hardware Key

Playground for experimenting with a Bitwarden Hardware Key.

## Platform

This project is built on the popular ESP32 platform. The ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. It is a popular choice for IoT projects and is well supported by multiple framework. We are using `esp-rs` which based on ESP-IDF, the official development framework for the ESP32. EPS-IDF is written in C, but `esp-rs` provides a Rust wrapper around it. ESP-IDF is in turn based on FreeRTOS, a popular real-time operating system.

## Hardware requirements

This project is currently being developed on an Adafruit HUZZAH32 â€“ ESP32 Feather Board connected to a 128x32 OLED FeatherWing. This board is a development board for the ESP32 microcontroller. It has a built-in USB-to-Serial converter, making it easy to program and debug. It also has a built-in LiPo battery charger, making it easy to power the board with a rechargeable battery.

### Simulation

This project does not currently support simulation/emulation.

## Getting started

The following steps are based on https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template#prerequisites. Please refer to that document in case this one is outdated.

  1. `brew install cmake ninja dfu-util libuv`
  2. Optional: `brew install ccache`
  3. `xcode-select --install`
  4. `/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license` 
     If you get an error similar to the following:
     ```
     WARNING: directory for tool xtensa-esp32-elf version esp-2021r2-patch3-8.4.0 is present, but tool was not found
     ERROR: tool xtensa-esp32-elf has no installed versions. Please run 'install.sh' to install it.
     ```

     or:

     ```
     zsh: bad CPU type in executable: ~/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32-elf/esp-2021r2-patch3-8.4.0/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin/xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc
     ```
  5. Make sure rustup is installed: https://rustup.rs/ (ideally this is how you've installed rust on your system)
  6. `cargo install espup espflash cargo-espflash`
     - If you have issues with OpenSSL you can try an alternative binary install:
       - `cargo install binstall`
       - `cargo binstall espup espflash cargo-espflash`
  6. `cargo install cargo-generate ldproxy cargo-espflash`
  7. `espup install`
  8. `. $HOME/export-esp.sh`
    This step must be done every time you open a new terminal.
        See other methods for setting the environment in https://esp-rs.github.io/book/installation/riscv-and-xtensa.html#3-set-up-the-environment-variables
  9. Clone repository

## Building and flashing

In theory `cargo run` should be enough.

### Troubleshooting

#### C-compilation error
Issue: https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template/issues/174

If you get an error similar to the following:
```
The C compiler

      "/Users/andreas/code/playground/esp32-playground-win/.embuild/espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32-elf/esp-12.2.0_20230208/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin/xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc"

    is not able to compile a simple test program.

    It fails with the following output:

      Change Dir: /Users/andreas/code/playground/esp32-playground-win/target/xtensa-esp32-espidf/debug/build/esp-idf-sys-9cd14215ea73b32d/out/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp
```

Workaround: `CRATE_CC_NO_DEFAULTS=1 cargo run`
