# POC: Bitwarden Hardware Key

Playground for experimenting with a Bitwarden Hardware Key.

## Hardware

This project is built on the popular ESP32 platform. The ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. It is a popular choice for IoT projects and is well supported by the Arduino IDE. But we are not using the Arduino IDE for this project. Instead, we are using `esp-rs` which based on ESP-IDF, the official development framework for the ESP32.
